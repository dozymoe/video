video
=====
this project is for a neighborhood data library. it is called video because the primary focus is video files.

in indonesia internet is relatively very expensive and only 10% of the population has access to high speed internet.

this project is for locating a digital library, with video, inside the neighborhood, allowing local residents to access large files without high speed internet access.

the project will be upgraded over time as it is deployed in the field and as funding allows.
