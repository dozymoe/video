This project is for a neighborhood data library. It is called video because the primary focus is offline video training files.

The library will provide high quality training videos to as many people as possible at the lowest price. The revenue model is cost-recovery only.

In Indonesia bandwidth is quite expensive, and only 10% of the population has access to high speed internet.

This project is for locating a digital library of training videos inside the neighborhood, allowing local residents to access large files without high speed internet access.

The project will be upgraded over time as it is deployed in the field and as funding allows.

The idea for this project came from a collision of factors here in Indonesia. Here's what people here have to deal with:

* Average income for a family is 60USD per month (Per Capita GDP is rising, but benefits don't reach the rural poor, which is our aim).
* High school fees can range from 20USD-50USD per month. Less than 10% of high schools in Indonesia are free. Fees are often levied on students in Elementary and Junior High School as well.
* High speed internet costs at least 40USD per month for 1mbps, the minimum for watching an sort of video.
* Trade school tuition costs range from 40USD-800USD per month.

These factors come together to illustrate just how difficult it is for the average Indonesian to attain skills needed employment or successful entrepreneurship.

Once a library is established and students gather it is our intention to support the development of training rooms to provide in-person instruction, following up to what training video can offer.
